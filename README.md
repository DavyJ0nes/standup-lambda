# Standup Lambda

This is a toy project that utilises AWS Lambda to send a message everyday to HipChat at a set time to remind a team to submit a stand up report.

It is triggered from a CloudWatch Event that itself is triggered from a cron schedule.

I am using Claudia.json as the framework to help speed up deployements. More info can be found [here](https://claudiajs.com/)

## TODO
- Improve deployment documentation
